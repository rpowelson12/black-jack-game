Simple black jack game in command prompt
I have decided to make a blackjack game for my first project. The code is probably able to be much cleaner, but I believe that it is all functional at this point. I would appreciate any feedback that you may have! This will all help me in my learning!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my code!
